# GDExtension loading file generation for Rust
This crate aims to provide a way to autogenerate a `.gdextension` file for using `Rust` to make a `Godot` `GDExtension`. It provides all the libraries pathfinding and a way to automatically link the default icons to the new defined classes based on the class they inherit from, and also a way to manually link a specific class with a custom icon. For more information, read the [documentation](https://docs.rs/gdext-gen), or the [source code](https://github.com/sylbeth/gdext-generation).

# Installation

To install this crate as a build dependency in your own crate, run: `cargo add --build gdext-gen`. If you instead want it added as a normal dependency run: `cargo add gdext-gen`.

# Usage

To get all the functionality of this crate, in your `build.rs` file on the root of your crate (not your `src/`), write the following:

```rust
use gdext_gen::generate_gdextension_file;

fn main() {
    // All your variable initialization and setup goes here.
    generate_gdextension_file(target_dir, gdextension_path, configuration, windows_abi, icons_configuration, dependencies);
}
```

The parameters of this function and how it works are documented in the docs. It should be kept in mind that this function returns an `std::io::Result`, so the following code could be used instead:

```rust
use std::io::Result;
use gdext_gen::generate_gdextension_file;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // All your variable initialization and setup goes here.
    generate_gdextension_file(target_dir, gdextension_path, configuration, windows_abi, icons_configuration, dependencies)?;
}
```

To compile for `Android`, `Web`, `MacOS` or `iOS` please refer to the [`godot-rust` book](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/toolchain/index.html).

It's worth noting that one can configure when the build script will be run, so it's sensible to change it were one not to need it running at every source file change.

# Acknowledgements

* This crate is based on the [`gdextension_file` documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/gdextension_file.html) from [`Godot`](https://godotengine.org/), and some snippets of the documentation (all written by [paddy-exe](https://github.com/paddy-exe)) are taken as are from their documentation, so they are as accurate as possible.

* This crate is meant to work in tandem with [`godot-rust`](https://godot-rust.github.io/) to give the most painless use of [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for `Godot`'s `GDExtension`, automating a helpful bunch of the work. It could be use on its own, just to generate the `.gdextension` file, but it works best with it.
